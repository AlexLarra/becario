 # Becario

 Becario is a Ruby-based CLI tool that automates iterative pull request improvements using OpenAI's Codex. It cycles through objectives, makes incremental changes, commits via your shell functions, and optionally waits between iterations.

 ## Requirements

 - Ruby (>= 2.5)
 - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and in your PATH
 - Shell functions `iacommit()` and `ask_openai()` available in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` (see https://github.com/AlexLarra/dotfiles/blob/master/sh/sh_functions)
 - Environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to your OpenAI API key
 - If you use tmux, ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is forwarded into tmux sessions. Add the following to your `~/.tmux.conf`, or copy lines 5â€“8 from https://github.com/AlexLarra/dotfiles/blob/283b3a3095994fbb2407338fd8993d640cdd1405/code/tmux/.tmux.conf#L5-L8:

   ```tmux
   # Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is passed into tmux sessions if you use it.
   set -g update-environment "OPENAI_API_KEY"
   set-environment -g OPENAI_API_KEY "#{ENV:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
   ```

 ## Installation

 ```bash
 cd ~/workspace  # navigate to your workspace
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/becario.git
 ```

 ## Usage

 From your project root (parent directory of `becario` in your workspace), run:

 ```bash
 ruby ../becario/assistant.rb "<PR Objectives>" [delay_mins]
 ```

 - `<PR Objectives>`: Description of what the pull request should achieve.
 - `[delay_mins]`: (Optional) Minutes to wait between iterations (default: 0).

 Example:
 ```bash
 ruby ../becario/assistant.rb "Refactor authentication flow and add tests" 10
 ```
